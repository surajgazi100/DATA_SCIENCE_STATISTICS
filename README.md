Descriptive Statistics:

The type of statistics dealing with numbers (numerical facts, figures, or information) to describe any phenomena. These numbers are descriptive statistics. e.g. Reports of industry production, cricket batting averages, government deficits, Movie Ratings etc.
Inferential statistics

Inferential statistics
is a decision, estimate, prediction, or generalization about a population, based on a sample. A population is a collection of all possible individual, objects, or measurements of interest. A sample is a portion, or part, of the population of interest. Inferential statistics is used to make inferences from data whereas descriptive statistics simply describe whatâ€™s going on in our data.
Measures of Central Tendency

A measure of central tendency is a summary statistic that represents the center point or typical value of a dataset. These measures indicate where most values in a distribution fall and are also referred to as the central location of a distribution. You can think of it as the tendency of data to cluster around a middle value. In statistics, the three most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. Each of these measures calculates the location of the central point using a different method.
