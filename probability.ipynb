        "1. What is Probability?\n",
        "Simply put, probability is an intuitive concept. We use it on a daily basis without necessarily realising that we are speaking and applying probability to work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Life is full of uncertainties. We don’t know the outcomes of a particular situation until it happens. Will it rain today? Will I pass the next math test? Will my favorite team win the toss? Will I get a promotion in next 6 months? All these questions are examples of uncertain situations we live in. Let us map them to few common terminology which we will use going forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Experiment – are the uncertain situations, which could have multiple outcomes. Whether it rains on a daily basis is an experiment.\n",
        "Outcome is the result of a single trial. So, if it rains today, the outcome of today’s trial from the experiment is “It rained”\n",
        "Event is one or more outcome from an experiment. “It rained” is one of the possible event for this experiment.\n",
        "Probability is a measure of how likely an event is. So, if it is 60% chance that it will rain tomorrow, the probability of Outcome “it rained” for tomorrow is 0.6\n",
        "Why do we need probability?\n",
        "In an uncertain world, it can be of immense help to know and understand chances of various events. You can plan things accordingly. If it’s likely to rain, I would carry my umbrella. If I am likely to have diabetes on the basis of my food habits, I would get myself tested. If my customer is unlikely to pay me a renewal premium without a reminder, I would remind him about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "So knowing the likelihood might be very beneficial.\n",
        "\n",
        " \n",
        "\n",
        "2. Random Variables\n",
        "To calculate the likelihood of occurence of an event, we need to put a framework to express the outcome in numbers. We can do this by mapping the outcome of an experiment to numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s define X to be the outcome of a coin toss.\n",
        "\n",
        "X = outcome of a coin toss\n",
        "\n",
        "Possible Outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1 if heads\n",
        "0 if tails\n",
        "Let’s take another one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose, I win the game if I get a sum of 8 while rolling two fair dice. I can define my random variable Y to be (the sum of the upward face of two fair dice )\n",
        "\n",
        "Y can take values = (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)\n",
        "\n",
        "A few things to note about random variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "Each value of the random variable may or may not be equally likely. There is only 1 combination of dice, with sum 2{(1,1)}, while a sum of 5 can be achieved by {(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)}. So, 5 is more likely to occur as compared to 2. On the contrary, the likelihood of a head or a tail in a coin toss is equal and 50-50.\n",
        "Sometimes, the random variables can only take fixed values, or values only in a certain interval. For example in a dice, the top face will only show values between 1 and 6. It cannot take a 2.25 or a 1.5. Similarly, when a coin is flipped, it can only show heads and tails and nothing else. On the other hand, if I define my random variable to be the amount of sugar in orange. It can take any value like 1.4g, 1.45g, 1.456g, 1.4568g as so on. All these values are possible and all infinite values between them are also possible. So, in this case, the random variable is continuous with a possibility of all real numbers.\n",
        "Don’t think random variable as a traditional variable (even though both are called variables) like y=x+2, where the value of y is dependent on x. Random variable is defined in terms of the outcome of a process. We quantify the process using the random variable.\n",
        " \n",
        "\n",
        "3. Calculating Probability by principle of counting\n",
        "Let’s say you went to a fair. There is a stall playing the game of spinning wheel. There are two colors evenly spread on the wheel – red and green. If you land on red, you lose, if you land on green you win.\n",
        "\n",
        "So what happens when you spin the wheel? You either win or you lose? There is no third outcome in this case. If the wheel is fair, there is a 50% chance of winning and 50% chance of losing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, suppose the organizer decides to increase the prize money and reduce the green area. Now only ¼th area is green and ¾th is red.\n",
        "\n",
        "How likely are you to win now?\n",
        "\n",
        "Only 25%! This 25% or .25 is the probability of winning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two throws of a dice\n",
        "The next stall is our favorite dice stall, where we win if we get a sum of 8 in two throws. Let’s see if we have more chances to win here.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s take random variable X to be the sum of two throws. X can take values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). Let’s see the probability of each number.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s see the probability of each number.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 6 possibilities in the first throw (we can get any number) and same 6 in the second. So total number if combinations would be 36.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s see how:\n",
        "\n",
        "2{(1,1)}  => 1/36\n",
        "\n",
        "3{(1,2),(2,1)} => 2/36\n",
        "\n",
        "4{(2,2),(3,1),(1,3)} => 3/36\n",
        "\n",

        "8{(2,6),(6,2),(3,5),(5,3),(4,4)} => 5/36\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "12{(6,6)} = > 1/36\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the chance of success here is 5/36 or approximately 1 in 7, while failure is 31/36. So, unless the stall rewards me 7x of the money I bet on winning, it is a bad game to participate in.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can write this as:\n",
        "\n",
        "p (Success)= 5/36\n",
        "p (Failure)= 31/36\n",
        "You can also see that the total probability is 1. There are only these 2 possibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s see how these probabilities look like. The probability function for a discrete random variable is the probability mass function. It shows the exact probabilities for a particular value of the random variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an important thing to note, a sum of 2.5 is not possible on the throw of two dice. So essentially, my random variable is discrete. There are only fixed integer values that it can take and we can see the probabilities of each occurring.\n",

        "4. Binomial Distribution\n",
        "Most of the times, the situations we encounter are pass-fail type. The democrats either win or lose the election. I either get a heads or tails on the coin toss. You either win or lose your football game (assuming that there is always a forced outcome). So there are only two outcomes – win and lose or success and failure. The likelihood of the two may or may not be the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us understand this through an interesting example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s say your football team is playing a series of 5 games against your opponent. Who ever wins more games (out of 5) wins the title.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let us say, your team might is more skilled and has 75% chances of winning. So, there is a 25% chance of losing it.\n",

        "\n",
        "So for the first game, there are two possibilities, you either win or lose, again for the second game we have two possibilities. Assuming that the first game has no effect on the outcome of the second – No one gets tired, no one gets under pressure after losing etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "So let’s define our random variable X to be a number of wins in 5 games. Remember probability of winning is 0.75 and losing is 0.25. Assume that a tie doesn’t happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "X=Number of wins in 5 games\n",

        "So the first game has 2 outcomes – win and lose, second again has 2 and so on.\n",

        "The normal distribution informally called as a bell curve looks like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The equation of the normal distribution happens to be:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here µ is the mean of the data while σ is the standard deviation of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical about the mean. The probabilities move similarly in both directions around the mean. The total area under the curve is 1, since summing up all the possible probabilities would give 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "The distribution might vary a bit depending upon how spread the data is. If the data has a very high range and standard deviation, the normally distributed curve would be spread out and flatter, since a large number of values would be sufficiently away from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, if a lot of values are away from the mean, the probability for data being around the mean also drops. Similarly, if the standard deviation is low, which means most of the values are near around the mean, there is high probability of the sample mean being around the mean and the distribution is a lot skinnier. The higher the standard deviation, the thicker and flatter the curve.\n",

        "If I have a population data and I take random samples of equal size from the data, the sample means are approximately normally distributed\n",
        "There is large probability for the means to be around the actual mean of the data, than to be farther away\n",

        "\n",
        "The mean value (µ) for cholesterol of all the patients is equal to 150 and standard deviation (σ) is equal to 15. The probability density function is a normal distribution given by the above equation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Can you see that the healthy patients that we are talking about are one standard deviation on either side of the mean? This means we need to calculate the area under the curve with 135 and 165 as limits. Don’t worry, this area for normal distribution is already calculated for us and is ~68%.\n",
        "\n",
        "So always for a normally distributed data, around 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean. So probability of the data being within 1 standard deviation if the mean = 0.68\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s also calculate the probability of being 2 standard deviations away from the mean. Let’s say we need to warn the patients who are two standard deviations away.\n",

        "\n",
        "So, 95% of the patients have their cholesterol levels between 120 and 180. And the remaining 5% are really critical and different from the average values.\n",

        "\n",
        "The distance in terms of number of standard deviations, the observed value is away from the mean, is the standard score or the Z score.\n",

        "Now, we would need to use these limits to calculate the area under the curve. Remember that the area under the curve is 1. Let’s calculate the probability of people having a cholesterol level of less than 172.\n",
        "\n",
        "To your happiness, you will never have to actually calculate the area under the normal curve, we have the z table that can be used to calculate the probabilities for particular z values. The rows of the Z table have the Z score in tens, while the hundredths decimal is given by the columns. The value is the area under the curve less than that Z score.\n",

        "For a particular z score, we can look into the table to find the probability for values to fall less than that particular z value. It can be –ve or +ve. If we look out for 1.47, we find that ~93% data falls less than that. Therefore, 93% patients have cholesterol less than 172. Also, we can safely say that 7% have cholesterol more than 172.\n",
